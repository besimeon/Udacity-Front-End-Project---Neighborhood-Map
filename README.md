# Udacity FullStack Nanodegree Front-End Project:  Neighborhood Map

This project is for the Front-End section of the Fullstack Nanodegree. It displays a Google Map section and a navigation section. The navigation options include a filter for marker groups, a listing of markers in a given group, and a display of photos attained via the Foursquare API for each marker location. The DOM is manipulated by the MVVM-structured javascript file "mvvm.js" which utilizes the Knockout.js library also included in the project.  


# Installation

This project will run in any web browser with Javascript enabled and internet access. Open the file "index.html" in your browser of choice to view the project. 


# Navigating the project

-Click on a given marker in the map window to view the title of the location in an infowindow.  
-Click on the filter dropdown in the navigation section on the left-hand-side of the page to display a specific group of markers.  
-Click on a marker line item in the navigation section to display an infowindow for the corresponding marker on the map.  
-Upon clicking a marker line item, you will notice images aquired from the given marker location's Foursquare page displayed below the marker list.  If no images are found or access to the Foursquare API is disrupted, a message in-place of the pictures will display to indicate as such.

 Enjoy navigating the regular locations I visit in my little town in the outskirts of NOLA.
